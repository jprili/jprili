Hello ðŸ‘‹,

It is me, James.  
Graduated with B.Sc. in Physics at UBC.  
Former RF Automation Engineer at NETGEAR.  
I am currently attending BCIT for the Computer Systems Technology Diploma.

When I'm not doing anything involving the aforementioned,  
I may be writing code for my personal projects.  

Thank you for visiting my profile, 
and feel free to ask me questions.

-James
